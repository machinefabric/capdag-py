"""CborRelay — Transparent CBOR frame relay with two relay-specific frame types.

The relay is a byte-stream bridge between an engine (master) and a plugin host runtime
(slave). Two relay-specific frame types are intercepted and never leaked through:

- **RelayNotify** (slave -> master): Capability advertisement from the slave's plugin host runtime.
- **RelayState** (master -> slave): Host system resources from the engine.

All other frames pass through transparently in both directions.
